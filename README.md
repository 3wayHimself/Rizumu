# Rizumu <3

## What is Rizumu?
Rizumu, an open source rhythm game inspired by games like Osu!, Taiko and DDR.
I've personally been a rhythm game fan for quite a while, so I decided: *"Hey, I can program.. Why not make my own?"*
That's where this project was born.

## History
I've started this as a closed source project, as I was afraid of other people stealing my code.
Though now I have realised not everyone is evil. When I started this project, I immediately decided i did NOT want to worry about game engine licenses etc.
I had to choose something that didn't cause any trouble when releasing it. That's where I found Monogame.
Seeing monogame was based off Microsoft's XNA, I was very happy. One of my favourite rhythm games was also written with XNA: Osu!.
At the beginning my code was very messy, though it worked. **Everything was written in ONE cs file..** After a while I realised: I can't do this. I need to rewrite the game for the sake of clean code. I rewrite the game in a month(!) while the original game took me about 4 months. After not writing any code for a while and a couple of people honestly wanted to play the game, I decided to open source the game. Though it did not feel the way I want it to. That's why I've decided to rewrite the game once again, completely open source. I hope everyone will like this game. Thank you
